extends Node2D
## World scene orchestrator — wires the scene graph from autoloads and
## sets up initial world-level state.
##
## Per CLAUDE.md, the world scene is the natural owner of scene-wiring from
## autoloads (dependency injection point). Direct autoload access is acceptable
## here specifically because this node's job is orchestration.

	_set_minimum_window_size()


## Prevent the OS window from being dragged smaller than the 2× scale size.
##
## The smallest selectable scale in the Settings tab is 2×, which gives a
## 640×360 window. Below that the stretched viewport becomes illegibly small.
## Setting Window.min_size to 2× the base viewport enforces the same floor the
## Settings UI offers.
##
## Units note: the project runs with `allow_hidpi=false`, so Godot measures the
## window in logical points (matching what macOS reports and what the Settings
## scale labels show). This is deliberate — on HiDPI "scaled" displays Godot
## cannot reliably detect the backing scale factor (DisplayServer.screen_get_scale
## returns the wrong value), so physical-pixel sizing would make every window
## appear at roughly half its intended on-screen size. See the pixel-art-purist
## refactor notes.
##
## We derive the base viewport size from ProjectSettings rather than
## hard-coding (640, 360) so this stays correct if the viewport resolution
## is ever changed in project.godot without touching this script.
